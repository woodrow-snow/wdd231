When Review the audit tool for the index page I came across the following errors:

In the w3.org Validation Report Section, I was given a fail for the css validation (Please see screen shot "w3-validation.png"). when clicking on the link provided I received the information in "w3-css-validation-report.png" which states that my index page has no errors.

In the Naming Conventions section (please see naming-issues-files.png), I received a fail for the following file: style.css?v=515aca75b31a555e03afd6acc088430cc58cd744. That file does not exist in my repository, please see it at https://github.com/woodrow-snow/wdd231
