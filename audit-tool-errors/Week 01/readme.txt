When Review the audit tool for the index page I came across the following errors in the audit tool:

In the <head> Elements section, I was given two errors regarding the meta author and description elements. I can confirm that they are there. Please see the repository here: https://github.com/woodrow-snow/wdd231/blob/main/index.html. Is the audit tool look for that information in the specific order of description then author?

I also ran into an issue with the report where the chamber and final <a> links were failing but looking at my code in my repository, you can see that the href attribute for those links have only empty string. Please see the above link to see what I mentioned.
